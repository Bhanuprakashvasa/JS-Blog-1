=> JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language, meaning that everything in JavaScript is an object.

=>In JavaScript, an object is a collection of properties, which are key-value pairs. These properties can be functions, data, or other objects. Objects can be created using the Object constructor, or by using object literal notation, which is the most common way of creating objects in JavaScript.

=>In JavaScript, objects are internally represented as a collection of properties. Each property has a name and a value. The name of the property is a string, and the value can be any valid JavaScript value, including functions and other objects.

=>Objects in JavaScript are also dynamic, which means that properties can be added, removed, or modified at any time. This is different from other programming languages like Java, where objects are static, and their properties cannot be modified once they are defined.

=>Objects can be accessed in JavaScript using dot notation or bracket notation. 

Dot Notation example:

const car = {
  make: 'Toyota',
  model: 'Innova',
  year: 2021
};
console.log(car.make); 

Output: Toyota

Bracket Notation example:

const person = {
  "first name": "Bhanu",
  "last name": "vasa",
  age: 23
};
console.log(person["first name"]);

Output: Bhanu

Conclusion:
=>Objects are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, and they are internally represented as a collection of properties with a prototype chain. They are dynamic, which means that properties can be added, removed, or modified at any time. Understanding how objects work in JavaScript is essential for writing effective and efficient code.
